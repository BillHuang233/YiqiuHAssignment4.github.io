  <h1>My favorite board game</h1>

  <p>Magic the Gathering is my favorite board game. It is the first trading card game, which makes it more interesting
    to play because you can enjoy the feeling to collect cards step by step and makes your own deck. </p>
  <p>I also joined UCI MTG club, where you can find a lot of people who also enjoy playing Magic the Gathering and they
    are very nice to the new member of the club. I spent great time with those guys!</p>
